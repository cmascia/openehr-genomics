This archetype has been designed to be expanded with CLUSTER archetypes, such as the CLUSTER.Genetic_findings, in order to report actual results, the devices or tools used, details about the specimen, and so forth.

This archetype is suitable to record genetic test results of an individual: multiple specimen analysis involving more than one sample, for instance from a family member in case of rare deseases studies, has to be handled at a COMPOSITION level">
